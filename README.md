# MACpy

The idea is to create and demonstrate a workflow to constrain the temperature of the upper lithospheric mantle (ULM) upto the Lithosphere-Aesthenosphere Boundary (LAB) using the xenolith data and the resistivity information from a MT survey.
The python notebooks in the tutorial folder explain the code. Presently they are not compiled into a package but are ready to use by any person having some familiarity with Python.
